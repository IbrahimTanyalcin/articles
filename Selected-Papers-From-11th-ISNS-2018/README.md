# DATASET for ISNS 2018

inside I-PV folder:
- datatracks: these are intermediate files for circos, you can ignore these
- input
   - alignment.txt: contains the species that are used to generate conservation scores
   - average_deogen2_per_aa.txt: average deogen2 scores for each position. You can use these with [indoril](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/148122v1.article-info) as shown in the youtube links below
   - conservation.txt: contains scores between 1-11 for each position
   - deogen2Marker.txt: this is a marker file that you can use to plot on the [I-PV](https://distreau.com/articles/ISNS2018/GAA.html) graph
   - fasta.txt: amino acid sequence of GAA
   - mrna.txt: mrna transcript sequence of GAA
   - mart_export.txt: all variations including SNVs, indels, deletions and insertions from Ensembl Variation 97
   - launchApp.jnlp: jalview file for the alignment
- GAA.html this is the I-PV graph of GAA. It's my former work, you can find it at http://i-pv.org/. You can open a live example at https://distreau.com/articles/ISNS2018/GAA.html

If you find any of the above work useful please cite the I-PV [**paper**](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/3/447/1743584) and the [**repository**](https://github.com/IbrahimTanyalcin/I-PV) 

We also are working on a worksheet concept where we derived most of our statistics and figures from for the ISNS 2018 paper,the concept is briefly shown below:

You can go ahead, fill out the survey AND subscribe for an account at [**MutaFrame**](https://deogen2.mutaframe.com/), you'll be notified if the concept airs.

If you want to use the above datafiles to venture into GAA using I-PV, you can open up the [**live**](https://distreau.com/articles/ISNS2018/GAA.html) sample and follow the below short videos (no audio):
